        <p>
          I am a software developer with experience in front-end and back-end
          development for ecommerce websites and applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I changed careers to become a developer because I wanted the ability
          to not only identify problems and opportunities, but to build the
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I value doing things the right way from the
          start and believe that investing the effort up front always pays off in
          the long run. Attention to detail, constant growth and team work are
          my priorities.
        </p>
      </div>
    </SectionBase>
